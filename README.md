```
Given that multiple tasks exist 
When I list the tasks 
Then the task description and task status on each line lines up vertically
And Each row is underlined in gray
```

Steps:
- The description should take up 90% of the row
- The status should take up 10% of the row
- The row should be underlined in gray
- The status text should be centered within its background color
- The status should be at least 4em wide but can grow larger
- The status should be exactly 1em tall
